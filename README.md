# hnp_participation_map
Map of HNP participation by Census tract within the Reno-Carson City-Fernley Consolidated Statistical Area. Made in R and output to HTML using the MapView plugin.

This repository contains working R code to produce the map, as well as R code to identify clusters of Census tracts with relatively high poverty rates. Input data are from the American Community Survey 5-year files for 2020; later updates to this code will use 2021 vintage 5-year files.
